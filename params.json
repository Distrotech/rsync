{"name":"Rsync","tagline":"Mirror of clone git://git.samba.org/rsync.git","body":"WHAT IS RSYNC?\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nRsync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool for\r\nboth remote and local files.\r\n\r\nRsync uses a delta-transfer algorithm which provides a very fast method\r\nfor bringing remote files into sync.  It does this by sending just the\r\ndifferences in the files across the link, without requiring that both\r\nsets of files are present at one of the ends of the link beforehand.  At\r\nfirst glance this may seem impossible because the calculation of diffs\r\nbetween two files normally requires local access to both files.\r\n\r\nA technical report describing the rsync algorithm is included with this\r\npackage.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSAGE\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBasically you use rsync just like scp, but rsync has many additional\r\noptions.  To get a complete list of supported options type:\r\n\r\n    rsync --help\r\n\r\nSee the manpage for more detailed information.\r\n\r\n\r\nSETUP\r\n-----\r\n\r\nRsync normally uses ssh or rsh for communication with remote systems.\r\nIt does not need to be setuid and requires no special privileges for\r\ninstallation.  You must, however, have a working ssh or rsh system.\r\nUsing ssh is recommended for its security features.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, rsync can run in `daemon' mode, listening on a socket.\r\nThis is generally used for public file distribution, although\r\nauthentication and access control are available.\r\n\r\nTo install rsync, first run the \"configure\" script.  This will create a\r\nMakefile and config.h appropriate for your system.  Then type \"make\".\r\n\r\nNote that on some systems you will have to force configure not to use\r\ngcc because gcc may not support some features (such as 64 bit file\r\noffsets) that your system may support.  Set the environment variable CC\r\nto the name of your native compiler before running configure in this\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nOnce built put a copy of rsync in your search path on the local and\r\nremote systems (or use \"make install\").  That's it!\r\n\r\n\r\nRSYNC DAEMONS\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nRsync can also talk to \"rsync daemons\" which can provide anonymous or\r\nauthenticated rsync.  See the rsyncd.conf(5) man page for details on how\r\nto setup an rsync daemon.  See the rsync(1) man page for info on how to\r\nconnect to an rsync daemon.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEB SITE\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThe main rsync web site is here:\r\n\r\n    http://rsync.samba.org/\r\n\r\nYou'll find a FAQ list, downloads, resources, HTML versions of the\r\nmanpages, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAILING LISTS\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThere is a mailing list for the discussion of rsync and its applications\r\nthat is open to anyone to join.  New releases are announced on this\r\nlist, and there is also an announcement-only mailing list for those that\r\nwant official announcements.  See the mailing-list page for full\r\ndetails:\r\n\r\n    http://rsync.samba.org/lists.html\r\n\r\n\r\nBUG REPORTS\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nTo visit this web page for full the details on bug reporting:\r\n\r\n    http://rsync.samba.org/bugzilla.html\r\n\r\nThat page contains links to the current bug list, and information on how\r\nto report a bug well.
