<a name="what-is-rsync" class="anchor" href="#what-is-rsync"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>WHAT IS RSYNC?</h2>

<p>Rsync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool for
both remote and local files.</p>

<p>Rsync uses a delta-transfer algorithm which provides a very fast method
for bringing remote files into sync.  It does this by sending just the
differences in the files across the link, without requiring that both
sets of files are present at one of the ends of the link beforehand.  At
first glance this may seem impossible because the calculation of diffs
between two files normally requires local access to both files.</p>

<p>A technical report describing the rsync algorithm is included with this
package.</p>

<h2>
<a name="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>USAGE</h2>

<p>Basically you use rsync just like scp, but rsync has many additional
options.  To get a complete list of supported options type:</p>

<pre><code>rsync --help
</code></pre>

<p>See the manpage for more detailed information.</p>

<h2>
<a name="setup" class="anchor" href="#setup"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SETUP</h2>

<p>Rsync normally uses ssh or rsh for communication with remote systems.
It does not need to be setuid and requires no special privileges for
installation.  You must, however, have a working ssh or rsh system.
Using ssh is recommended for its security features.</p>

<p>Alternatively, rsync can run in `daemon' mode, listening on a socket.
This is generally used for public file distribution, although
authentication and access control are available.</p>

<p>To install rsync, first run the "configure" script.  This will create a
Makefile and config.h appropriate for your system.  Then type "make".</p>

<p>Note that on some systems you will have to force configure not to use
gcc because gcc may not support some features (such as 64 bit file
offsets) that your system may support.  Set the environment variable CC
to the name of your native compiler before running configure in this
case.</p>

<p>Once built put a copy of rsync in your search path on the local and
remote systems (or use "make install").  That's it!</p>

<h2>
<a name="rsync-daemons" class="anchor" href="#rsync-daemons"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>RSYNC DAEMONS</h2>

<p>Rsync can also talk to "rsync daemons" which can provide anonymous or
authenticated rsync.  See the rsyncd.conf(5) man page for details on how
to setup an rsync daemon.  See the rsync(1) man page for info on how to
connect to an rsync daemon.</p>

<h2>
<a name="web-site" class="anchor" href="#web-site"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>WEB SITE</h2>

<p>The main rsync web site is here:</p>

<p>You'll find a FAQ list, downloads, resources, HTML versions of the
manpages, etc.</p>

<h2>
<a name="mailing-lists" class="anchor" href="#mailing-lists"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>MAILING LISTS</h2>

list, and there is also an announcement-only mailing list for those that
want official announcements.  See the mailing-list page for full
details:</p>
