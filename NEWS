rsync changes in 2.6.0cvs

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * For Cygwin: (Ville Herva, Martin Pool)

       - Allow config files to contain CRLF

       - Don't check modes and ownership on config/password files,
         because this security test is more likely to be a pain than a
         help on Cygwin.

    * More detailed and clearer output from the --stats option (Martin
      Pool)
